# Fullstack Jr Java Screening

Clone the repo https://github.com/aoga88/springboot-test and create a branch named as test/dashed-user-date [test/aoga88-20181023], then solve the excersice and créate a pull request to master.

You need to add a crud service to manage an agenda (the data model is open, but be mindful).

Technical specs:

1.	It should have front end / back end separation.
2.	The front end is open (ReactJS is a plus)
3.	It can’t be form post requests, everything should connect to a REST service. 
4.	The data should be accesed using JPA (Entity – Repository – Service ).
5.	The system needs a user login (managed by Spring Security)
6.	Add a readme file with Screenshots as evidence

Good luck and happy coding!
